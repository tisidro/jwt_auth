# jwt_auth
Simple Json web token authorization project. Basic routes that allow user to register and login. Creates token to authenticate request using JWT so that only specific users can use the login request. No database, I just created a variable const = posts and stored the user information there (right in the server). 

This would not normally be done of course, but this was for me to practice and better understand the process of creating tokens.
